              Dedicated to health care, hospitals are the healing centers for a
              host of diseases and other physical & mental conditions. With
              specialized staff to look into specific concerns and great
              ambiances, todayâ€™s hospitals are known for their hospitality. In
              addition, the immensely responsible hospital staff make hospitals
              more than just a house for the sick. They have developed
              themselves to cure most of the diseases, thus helping out the
              mankind.

              Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually,
              it wins. And, in a war that you cannot win, you don't want a
              general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You want
              good doctors, someone who knows how to fight for territory that
              can be won and how to surrender it when it can't, someone who
              understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to
              the bitter end.
